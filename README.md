# Flower-iris-Model-Train
## Exercise 1

### Use sklearn.datasets iris flower dataset to train your model using logistic regression. You need to figure out accuracy of your model and use that to predict different samples in your test dataset. In iris dataset there are 150 samples containing following features,

#### Sepal Length
#### Sepal Width
#### Petal Length
#### Petal Width
### Using above 4 features you will clasify a flower in one of the three categories,

#### Setosa
#### Versicolour
### Virginica
# Digits Datasets 
## Exercise 2

### Train SVM classifier using sklearn digits dataset (i.e. from sklearn.datasets import load_digits) and then,

#### 1:Measure accuracy of your model using different kernels such as rbf and linear.
#### 2:Tune your model further using regularization and gamma parameters and try to come up with highest accurancy score
#### 3:Use 80% of samples as training data size
